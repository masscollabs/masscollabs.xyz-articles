<h1>Free Software in Cloud with a Convergent Approach</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;re planning a free software suite, but first a maintainer framework which is called <a href="https://github.com/masscollabs/cmf">Convergent Maintainer Framework</a>Â  It will make it easier to switch between different forges as a first and initial feature. We would like to integrate shell/terminal and other platforms such as web, desktop, mobile, and shell with Python&rsquo;s shell, like writing commands in IRC chats.</p>

<p>We are inspired by many software but We can say quickly some software 1. GNU Emacs, 2. rainbowstream, 3. Ubuntu&rsquo;s old Convergence model&rsquo;s philosophy.</p>

<p>Stay in touch with our GitHub account for more information. ( For now we are on GitHub ).</p>

<p>Happy Hacking !</p>
