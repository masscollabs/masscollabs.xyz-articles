# Free Software in Cloud with a Convergent Approach

We're planning a free software suite, but first a maintainer framework which is called [Convergent Maintainer Framework](https://github.com/masscollabs/cmf)Â  It will make it easier to switch between different forges as a first and initial feature. We would like to integrate shell/terminal and other platforms such as web, desktop, mobile, and shell with Python's shell, like writing commands in IRC chats.

We are inspired by many software but We can say quickly some software 1. GNU Emacs, 2. rainbowstream, 3. Ubuntu's old Convergence model's philosophy.

Stay in touch with our GitHub account for more information. ( For now we are on GitHub ).

Happy Hacking !
